AdvanceMap.ini:
--------------- 
The INI has been completely revamped.
Now every language has it's specific settings.
Further all games have some Game specifiy settings.
Last but not least, every offset is stored by a pattern.

Example:
[MapBankHeader]
art=pointer
nach=80180068890B091808687047
spiele=BPR,BPG,BPE,AXP,AXV

This means that after the Bytes after "nach" the Pointer to the Map Header is following.
This setting goes for all games which are listed under "spiele".


Example 2:
[PokemonNamen]
inkSprache=1
art=pointer
vor=30B50025084CC8F7
spiele=AXPJ,AXVJ,AXPE,AXVE

[PokemonNamen2]
art=pointer
position=$000144
spiele=BPR,BPG,BPE,AXP,AXV

Here are 2 entrys. In the 1st, all language parameters are set in the "spiele"- listing, because "inkSprache" is set to 1.
Also we have the pointer to the at point "vor" described Bytes.
Because not all games are used under the 1st entry, there's a 2nd entry which will be used for all games.
After the 2nd entry, the Pointer will be found at the position set in the "position" variable.


Hex values always have to carry a "$"!


Main.ini
--------
Here the orders with the corresponding maps are listed.
Many new orders can be produced at will.
The format is as follows:

[<Foldername>]
1=<Bank>.<map>
2=<Bank>.<map>
3=<Bank>.<map>
4=<Bank>.<map>
5=<Bank>.<map>
...

Example:
[0]
1=0.0
2=0.1
3=0.2
...

[1]
1=1.0
...

The foldernames can be changed as you please;

There are exceptions:
[<FolderName>]
1=<Label>
2=<Label>
...
For more, see Maps.ini


Maps.ini
--------
Here the maps are listed, but only the ones that are listed in Main.ini
appear.
[<Bank>.<map>]
Name=<Label>

[0.0]
Name=PETALBURG CITY

[1.0]
Name=Route 101

Important:
Here you should only alter the 'name' attribute.
The heading of the entry "[0.0]" refers to the position in the map header, if this is altered
then the maps will no longer work!
The offsets are no longer used in this version, however they can remain in there.

The exception:
Here for all game versions the exact offset to the Map Footer has to be declared.
Those without an offset won't be loaded.

[<Label from Main.ini>]
Name=<Label>
<Exact Gamelabel>=<Offset>


Example:
[UNKNOWN45] 
POKEMON SAPPAXPD=$2CA960 
name=Insel?


Tilesets.ini
------------
The tileset-builder is new from version 1.30.
Optionally, here you can change the number of blocks each tileset has (first tileset is 0)
If the tileset is in the upperpart it has 200 blocks automatically.

[1]
Blocks=$90

...

[24]
Blocks=$87


Sprachen.ini
------------
Here all languages that are available are listed.
Example:
[Sprachen]
1=Deutsch
2=English

In the subfolder "Ini/Sprachen" you can find a <Languagename>.ini-file, in which the texts are stored.
You can add as many languages as you want, but you have to take care of the "EndNutzer Vertrag".
The "EndNutzer Vertrag" has to be translated, and send to me so that I can encrypt it.
As long as I haven't done that, the language is not available....
You can change the language under "Settings"->"Language".

At the first start of AdvanceMap, you can select the language of your choice.

The files GehDaten.ini/AufgabenDaten.ini and others have been included in the new language files.
